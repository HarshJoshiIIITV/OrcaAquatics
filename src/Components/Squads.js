                    <Typography variant='body2'>From the time of its inception, Orca Aquatics' has always focused on having pathways that support the development of every swimmer to reach their true swimming potential. Over time, the reputation of Orca Aquatics at a performance swimming level has grown not only locally but world-wide, as the most successful swimming academy in the Middle East.
                    <br/><br/>

              Our squad structure is designed to be progressive for swimmers to develop through pathways in line with the Long-Term Athlete Development Plan. We offer four pathways that allow an opportunity for each swimmer to develop and train in line with their correct age, ability, commitment, goals and potential. This structure gives swimmers of all abilities and commitment to enjoy the sport equally.
              <br/><br/>

              Although staying away from their home country, we continue to offer young expat swimmers a programme that propels them to represent their nation at the highest level within the sport, and have had multiple swimmers represent their home country internationally.

                    Our Club Pathway allows an opportunity for both late swimming developers and swimmers of less swimming commitment to train as part of a fun and progressive environment. Training is delivered with individual goals in mind, ensuring that each swimmer gets to improve and enjoy their swimming. Coaches work with swimmers who wish to take their swimming further and want to compete or progress into higher squads in the future.

                    The Competition Pathway has evolved to support swimmers who are aiming to train and compete competitively. Training is delivered with individual goals in mind but importantly in line with the correct age and ability. Swimmers have full training available to them but with a slightly lower commitment and performance expectation than the Performance Pathway â€“ this allows swimmers to choose their commitment to fall in line with their goals.

                    When we speak of long-term athlete development within the Orca Aquatics programme, one of the absolute fundamental areas that we work on is technical skills and the process that it takes to develop world class technique.

                    <Typography variant='body2' style={{marginTop:'12px'}}>
                          Our approach is based on the belief that for swimmers to develop to their full potential, we need to put as few limiting factors on our swimmers as possible. Technical faults are one sure fire way of putting a ceiling on any swimmersâ€™ development and I wanted to use this blog post to give you some of the reasons why and how we look to address these issues as early as possible within our programme at Orca Aquatics.
